File Browser Applet
******************************
This is a C++ re-write of the original File Browser Applet (at
http://code.google.com/p/gnome-menu-file-browser-applet/) that is not dependent
on the GNOME2 panel. It has not yet reached feature parity with the original,
and as such the claimed feature list currently lies. The code base is much
cleaner though.

The applet lets you browse and open files in your home folder from the gnome
panel, without having to open a file manager. It is _not_ intended as
replacement to proper file managers like nautilus. Sometimes you (like me) just
want to open a file and don't want to have to open a file manager, browse to
and open the file, then close the file manager. This Applet just saves you
couple of clicks.

      icon, show/hide icon, show hidden, select terminal and editor.

Hacking
*******
Contributions and pull-requests are welcome, but it might take a while for them
to make it into a release as I (unfortunately) don't always have a lot of time
to devote to this project (and other lame excuses).
