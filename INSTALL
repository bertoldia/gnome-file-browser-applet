Installation Instructions
*************************

Requirements
************
You will need to have the binary and development files (and all their
dependencies) for the following packages installed to compile this program:

gtk-2.0 >= 2.14
gio-2.0
libpanel-applet-2.0

Some of the context menu actions require File-roller, Brasero and Rubber. You
can compile and run the applet without them though.

Optionally requires libgtkhotkey-1.0 for keyboard activation.

You will also need the following packages installed to compile this program:
pkg-config
CMake >= 2.4.7

Configuration
*************
There are 6 configuration options available:
    * CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX
    * CMAKE_INSTALL_LIB_PREFIX
    * CMAKE_INSTALL_LIB_EXEC_DIR
    * CMAKE_INSTALL_BONOBO_DIR
    * CMAKE_INSTALL_GCONF_SCHEMA_DIR
    * CMAKE_INSTALL_BUILDER_UI_DIR
    * ENABLE_GTK_HOTKEY

CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX specifies the base installation prefix. The following
other specific installation paths depend on this prefix:
 - CMAKE_INSTALL_LIB_PREFIX
 - CMAKE_INSTALL_GCONF_SCHEMA_DIR
 - CMAKE_INSTALL_BUILDER_UI_DIR
NOTE!!! The default is /usr/local but should be /usr for the applet-loader to find the applet.

CMAKE_INSTALL_LIB_PREFIX specifies the installation prefix of the binary
application file. Two other specific installation paths depend on this prefix:
 - CMAKE_INSTALL_LIB_EXEC_DIR
 - CMAKE_INSTALL_BONOBO_DIR
The default is CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/lib.

CMAKE_INSTALL_LIB_EXEC_DIR specifies the installation path of the binary
application file. The default is
CMAKE_INSTALL_LIB_EXEC_DIR=CMAKE_INSTALL_LIB_PREFIX/file-browser-applet

CMAKE_INSTALL_GCONF_SCHEMA_DIR specifies the installation prefix of the gconf schema
file. The default is CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/share/gconf/schemas

CMAKE_INSTALL_BUILDER_UI_DIR specifies the installation prefix of the gtk+
builder ui file. The default is CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/share/file-browser-applet/builder

CMAKE_INSTALL_BONOBO_DIR specifies the installation bonobo Server file. The
default is CMAKE_INSTALL_LIB_PREFIX/bonobo/servers

ENABLE_GTK_HOTKEY is used to manually disable the use of libgtkhotkey even if it found by cmake.
The default value is true, meaning that if libgtkhotkey is found it will be used.

Configuring
***********
Building out-of-source is recommended with CMake.  To configure out-of-source
using the defaults, run the following commands at the project root folder:

'mkdir build'
'cd build'
'cmake ../'

To specify an option, run (with the trailing ../):

'cmake -D CMAKE_OPTION=/new/option/value ../'

Compiling
*********
At the project's build directory, execute:

'make'

Installation
************
At the project's build directory, with root privileges execute:

'make install'

Similarly, to uninstall...

'make uninstall'
