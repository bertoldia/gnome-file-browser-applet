Browse and open files in your computer from the GNOME panel.
File Browser Applet is an applet for the GNOME Panel. It lets you browse and
open files in your home directory from the gnome panel, without having to open
a file manager. It is _not_ intended as replacement to proper file managers
like nautilus. Sometimes you (like me) just want to open a file and don't want
to have to open a file manager, browse to and open the file, then close the
file manager. This Applet just saves you couple of clicks.
